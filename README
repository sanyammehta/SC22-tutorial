This repository contains the following:
(1) original source code (and respective input files) for each of the 6 applications used in the experiments performed in the paper.
(2) the optimized source code for the files that changed
(3) Each sub-directory contains a README.SC.AD which describes the following:
    a. The file that changed and what the change was (for example, whether it contains pragmas for vectorization, software prefetching, tiled code, etc.)
    b. The Makefile that was used by the authors to build the application using the Cray compiler
    c. The build instructions
    d. The instructions used to generate instrumented binary
    e. The instructions used to run the application binary on SKL and KNL
(4) Camera-ready version of our ISPASS'22 Paper titled 'Performance Analysis and Optimization with Little's Law'. PLEASE NOTE that this work was selected to be a 'BEST PAPER NOMINEE' recently at ISPASS22. The work in this paper forms the basis of a good chunk of this tutorial.
